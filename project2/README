PROGRAM: Assignment 2
Author: Vincent Barfield

I've included a make file for graders use if they wish. It's been tested as well as the gcc method mentioned in the program specifications.

Output should roughly match the output shown in the project specifications though the logs may not be in exact format specified.

This program uses fork, shared memory, and execvp to accomplish a merge and quicksort. Everything runs concurrently and the output is printed at the end.

NOTE: There is a file 'shared.h' that is included in each of the source files. This provides macros and include statements.

I do not believe there are any race conditions.

The main file provides args to qsort and merge by a char pointer array where the pointers are allocated on the stack.
